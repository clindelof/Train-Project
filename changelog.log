This will be where all updates are documented.

03/30/2016 - Chris Lindelof - Added weighted graph data structure and methods. This will allow us to back our train map with a weight graph.
							- Added mapFile.txt - file to read map data from. First line is number of stations. Following lines are start, end, weight
							- Added Map.java - extends Graph.java to give lock/unlock abilities and making a map.
							- Added Edge.java - represents the start, end, and weight of a locked track
					
04/04/2016 - Chris Lindelof - Added JavaDoc comments to Graph.java
							- Added the addEdge(int, int, int) method to Map.java and implemented.
							- mapFile.txt represents the example map provided in the slides from the first class of the semester.
							- removed Map.java's string constructor. It will not be able to be implemented.
							- Added Departure.java to store route and departure times for trains
							- Added Driver to be the main executable file of program
							- Added TrainScheduler.java which is in charge of creating the Map and scheduling the trains
							- Added inputSchedule.txt - each line contains a starting station, ending station, and expected departure time for use in the TrainScheduler class
							- mapFile.txt has had first line (number of stations) removed because it is not going to be read from file.
							
04/06/2016 - Chris Lindelof - Added toString to Departute.java
							- removed shortestPath()
							- added LinkedList<Edge> dijkstra(int) 
							
04/16/2016 - Chris Lindelof - Added Dijkstra.java
							- removed dikstra(int) method
							- Optimization made in scheduling, if a dijkstra from that station has been made it uses it rather than making a new one. 
							- Graph.java now initialization all weights to Positive infinity (no possible connection)
							- Made realization that Graph.java does not support multiple edges between paths and will select the bigger weight to keep.
							- changed weight in Edge.java to a double
							- added a toString() to Edge.java
							- fixed a typo in Departure.java's toString()
							- updated mapFile.txt to not have any double edges
							
04/17/2016 - Chris Lindelof - add multi-graph functionality to Graph.java by using an arraylist<double> in all weight locations
							- add multi-graph support to Dijkstras 
							- Have the driver ask user for number of trains, randomly generate that many trains to schedule
							- Add Time.java to convert unit times to minutes in day
							- Map.java convert weights from compressed weights to actual weights representing distance

04/23/2016 - Chris Lindelof - Lock tracks by testing mode
							- working on moving the locks based on previous trains, so that we can calculate delays.
							- add more information to the equals() methods of Departure.java, Edge.java, and Train.java
							- add Testing.java, change int tests to max number of trains / 10 
							- set up Driver.java to export the results as txt and csv files that are names according to the test case and train count.
							- added line to .gitignore to ignore all files in the ./results/ directory created by the program exporting its data.
							
							- tweaked Gengbo's gui to work without collector method, and to provide input to Driver.java just like Testing.java does
