2. __Project Description:__  
 This project was assigned as the final project for Florida Institute of Technology's, Spring 2016, Algorithm's and Data Structures class. This program is meant to schedule trains along a network of tracks given a file with start point, end point, and departure time of a train.
 
 The goal of the project is to beat the average delay of trains when compared to the base case. 
 
 The base case of the project is that every track on the route of a train is locked until the train has arrived at its final station. 
 
 In order to beat the base case we have opened tracks that the train is no longer on, or has yet to reach. The track that a train is on is locked and only that track.
